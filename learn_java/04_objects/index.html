  <h1>Objects in Java</h1>

  <h2>StockTest*:</h2>

  <p>
      Imagine you're writing a stock trading program.  The most important
      feature is to get a list of the user's current stock portfolio, and to
      calculate its value.  So we start off writing an object that
      encapsulates a single stock, with fields (also known as variables,
      properties, or members) for symbol, price per share, and number of
      shares.  We also want a method that computes the dollar value per
      stock (price per share x number of shares).
  </p>

  <p>Use variables of type <tt>double</tt> for price and value.</p>

  <p>
      Get the ball rolling as follows:
  <pre><code>
            cd objects
            javac StockTest0.java
            [then, when the above passes...]
            java Test StockTest0
        </code></pre>
  then repeat for StockTest1, StockTest2, etc.
  </p>


  <h3>Notes on individual tests:</h3>

  <p>
      <b>testSetSymbol, testSetPrice, testSetNumShares</b>: write a straightforward
      property getter/setter for these three properties.
  </p>

  <p>
      <b>testSetNumShares</b> also requires a calculator method, <b>getValue</b>,
      that computes the value of the stock by multiplying the price by the number
      of shares.
  </p>
  <p>
      <b>testMultiArgumentConstructor</b>: a constructor is called when an object
      is first created (instantiated).  This is usually a good place to set
      the initial values of all properties.  Note that if you don't specify
      any constructor, the compiler always adds an implicit default
      constructor (one that takes no arguments); this means that if you
      <b>add</b> a non-default constructor, you will have to <b>also</b> add
      a default constructor if you want the old tests to work.  This can be
      done with a simple
  <pre><code>public Stock() { }</code></pre>
  </p>

  <p>
      <b>testTotalValue</b>: This test calls a <b>static</b> method called
      <tt>totalValue</tt> that takes an <b>array of Stocks</b> as a
      parameter.  A static method is attached to the object class itself,
      but not to any specific instance of that object.  The declaration for
      the <tt>totalValue</tt> method should be something like
  <pre><code>public static double totalValue(Stock[] stocks)</code></pre>
  </p>


  <p>
      <b>testToString</b>: Every Java object has a method called toString.
      It returns a string representing that object and its values.  toString
      is supposed to be used for debugging, not for showing to an end-user,
      so its output does not have to be pretty.  However, the default
      implementation of toString is <b>really</b> not pretty, so most people
      <b>override</b> toString and write their own.  The testToString method
      asks you to implement toString following the standard idiom of
      printing the name of the class, then its properties surrounded by [
      square brackets ].
  </p>

  <p>
      (When you call <tt>System.out.print(foo)</tt>, the <tt>print</tt>
      method actually invokes foo's <tt>toString</tt> method and prints that
      value.)
  </p>

  <p>
      <b>testEquals</b>: Java has two main concepts of equality.  The first
      is, "Are these two object references literally the same instance?"
      That is embodied by the == operator.  The second is, "Are the
      <b>contents</b> of these two objects the same?"  That is emodied by
      the <tt>equals</tt> method.  This test assures that two separate
      objects, created with the same values, are truly counted as equal.

  </p>

  <p>
      <b>testNotEquals</b>: This debugs your equals method, making sure that
      you are comparing all values and so forth.
  </p>

  <h2>PolymorphismTest*:</h2>

  <p>
      Polymorphism is the object-oriented property whereby two objects of
      different classes can be treated identically, at least to a certain
      extent.  Polymorphism is implemented in Java in two ways:
      <b>inheritance</b> and <b>interfaces</b>.  To implement these tests,
      you must first create an interface (or a superclass) called
      <tt>Asset</tt>, then make your Stock object <b>implement</b> (or
      <b>extend</b>) the Asset parent.  The only thing an Asset
      needs to do, for present purposes, is return its value, so Asset
      will only need a <tt>getValue</tt> method.
  </p>

  <p>
      You will then create another type of asset, a Savings Account.
      Then you will see how useful polymorphism is -- it
      allows you to (very slightly) change your totalValue method so it
      works on any type of asset, not just stocks.
  </p>

  <p>
      (From an object-oriented design point of view, this new totalValue
      method will be slightly out-of-place.  It's still in the Stock class,
      but is not restricted to Stocks.  We are about to clean this up by
      making a new object, Portfolio, that is devoted to holding collections
      of assets.)
  </p>

  <h2>PortfolioTest*:</h2>

  <p>
      Finally, we will make a Portfolio object, responsible for holding a
      group of assets.  Here let's not worry too much about making this
      object robust -- we will do that later, in the Collections lab.  For
      now, just make sure it will work for a collection of a few
      assets.
  </p>
